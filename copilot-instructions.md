# GitHub Copilot Instructions

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: The central source of truth for all LLM instructions is **[LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md](LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md)**. Please refer to that file for universal directives, architecture, and workflows.

## Copilot-Specific Guidelines

*   **Context Awareness**: Use the full file context to provide relevant suggestions. Pay attention to imports and types.
*   **Completeness**: Suggest complete blocks of code or function implementations, not just single lines.
*   **Patterns**: Match the existing coding style and conventions of the repository.
*   **Tests**: When suggesting a fix, also suggest a corresponding test case.
